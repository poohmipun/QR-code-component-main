"Embarking on my Frontend Journey! ðŸš€ Learning HTML and CSS with Frontend Mentor Challenges! ðŸ’»ðŸ“š"

I'm a newbie who found out about frontend mentor today and decided to give it a shot. After finishing, I realized how awful my knowledge of HTML and CSS is and how much I need to learn, so I'll be doing the challenges on a regular basis.
